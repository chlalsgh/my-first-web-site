Cascading Style Sheets—or CSS for short—is a stylesheet language
that tells a webpage how it should  look. It s used to describe
the presentation of a document written in a mark-up language like
HTML or XHTML, and it sets out things like colors, fonts and layout.
As such, it s a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web.
It s so powerful because it formats content without being a part of it.
It effectively modifies the look of content and cascades it across multiple
pages of a website, quickly and easily. This is important because it means
that the look of hundreds of pages can be altered centrally, in the
CSS file, without the need to edit each of those pages manually. It also means
that different CSS rules can be applied to fit the size of the device being
used to access the page, so with phones and tablets pages can
adjust on the fly. This makes any site extremely responsive and makes
content more accessible and easier to update. One single HTML page can be
offered in a number of different forms to suit different purposes, so the
same content can be adapted easily for on-screen reading, print or voice/touch
recognition software. CSS has a simple syntax and every style sheet has a set of
rules. They all have a number of selectors and a declaration block.
Declaration blocks are comprised of a list of declarations that are
book-ended by braces. They have a property, a colon (:), and a value.
