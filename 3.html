JavaScript is the name of a dynamic language which is based on classless
object-oriented (prototype-based) programming. Netscape created JavaScript
in 1994, although at first, they called it LiveScript. The script was used
in Netscapes browser, because they needed a language that both professionals
and amateurs would take to. Note that although the new name contains the
word “Java” it doesnt bear any resemblance to the Java programming language.
Some features may be similar, in that both languages are object-oriented
and the syntax they use looks like the syntax found in the C programming
language, but JavaScript has dynamic typing and it s weakly typed, while Java
has static typing. The JavaScript code also contains some functions influenced
by the Scheme programming language. The JavaScript engine or interpreter is the
piece of software that allows the script to be executed in applications or
web browsers. JavaScript engines are often found in browsers, so there’s no
need to enable JavaScript yourself because it’s already enabled. You can
change this in the browser itself if you want to. Chrome lets you enable
JavaScript in the Settings menu (look in the Privacy section for Content
settings). You can turn it off entirely or just a particular site.
In Firefox look in the Tools menu and choose Options. A pop-up window
will appear. Click on the Content tab and look for the Enable JavaScript option.
In IE the settings are also in the Tools menu. Look for the Internet
Options section where you will see the security settings. Select the Custom
Level button and then look for Active Scripting in the list. JavaScript is used
almost everywhere, and particularly with web applications. Web companies need
JavaScript to add more functions to their sites, and it is very useful
for handling interactive features like animations, media playback, data
validation, and receiving or sending data to the server without
reloading the page. It also makes it easier to track user activity.
In addition, JavaScript is versatile enough that it has found its way into
various software applications that don’t relate to the web
